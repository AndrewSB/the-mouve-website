<div class="body"><!-- <p class="s1">Frequently Asked Questions</p> -->

<p class="s3 s4">How does Roll work?</p>
<p class="s2">Roll is a new way to share your life with close friends.<br><br>Each time you open Roll, it checks to see if there are new photos on your camera roll. If there are, it shows them to you and lets you share them with a swipe.<br><br>With Roll, your friends will see events you went to, hikes you went on, pictures of your pets, and little peeks into your daily life.<br><br>There are no albums, filters, comments or captions. It's fast, simple photo sharing - without any of the fuss.</p>


<p class="s3 s4">How do I take a photo?</p>
<p class="s2">Roll makes it super fast to share the photos already on your phone. It's actually not possible to <i>take</i> photos in Roll.<br><br>If you see something you'd really like to share on Roll, take a photo of it with you normal iPhone Camera app. Then open Roll to share it.</p>


<p class="s3 s4">I just signed up and it says "That's it for now!" Where are my friends' photos?</p>
<p class="s2">You have to wait until they take some! There are no profiles or news feeds on Roll; think of it more like a messaging app.<br><br>People share pretty often on Roll, so if you have friends, you should start seeing photos soon. If you'd like to speed things up, try adding a few more.</p>


<p class="s3 s4">Am I oversharing?</p>
<p class="s2">No! Roll is not for sharing the single best photo from an event. It's for sharing all of the other ones. Screenshots, silly photos, and random retakes are all welcome. On Roll, photos move fast and people share a <i>lot</i>.</p>


<p class="s3 s4">Can people see everything on my camera roll?</p>
<p class="s2">No. Only photos you actively choose to share will be uploaded to Roll.</p>


<p class="s3 s4">Can people see when I take a screenshot of their photo?</p>
<p class="s2">No. Screenshot away!</p>


<p class="s3 s4">Can people see when I've downloaded their photo? </p>
<p class="s2">Nope.</p>


<p class="s3 s4">How do I download a photo?</p>
<p class="s2">When you're viewing a friend's photo, tap the download button, which is the second button from the lower left corner.</p>


<p class="s3 s4">How do I unshare a photo I accidentally shared?</p>
<p class="s2">Tap the button in the lower right of your feed to open your profile. Tap the photo you want to unshare, tap the ellipsis that appears on the lower right of the photo, then tap "Make this photo private."</p>


<p class="s3 s4">How do I view one of my own photos full size?</p>
<p class="s2">You can't do this yet, but you'll be able to soon!</p>


<p class="s3 s4">How do I tag a photo I've already shared?</p>
<p class="s2">That's another one on our list.</p>


<p class="s3 s4">Why can't I see my friends' photos more than once?</p>
<p class="s2">To keep the experience lightweight and snappy, you can only view photos you see once. If you'd like to keep a photo, you can always download it to your phone.</p>


<p class="s3 s4">Why can't I filter my photos, add captions, or comment on my friends' photos?</p>
<p class="s2">Lightweight again? We might add some of these things in the future, so please <span class="c1"><a href="mailto:feedback@tryroll.com">let us know</a></span> if you want them. :)</p>


<p class="s3 s4">Who can see the photos I share?</p>
<p class="s2">Roll is made for close friends and family, so by default, only the friends in your address book are allowed to follow you. If someone else asks to follow you, you'll have to approve their request.<br><br>To see who's receiving the photos you share, tap "Followers" on your profile. To stop sharing with someone, tap the block symbol next to their name. They won't be notified.<br><br>To see whose photos you're receiving, tap "Following" on your profile. To stop receiving photos from someone, tap the "Following" button next to their name to unfollow them. You can also unfollow someone by tapping the ellipsis at the upper right of any photo they share. Again, they won't be notified that you've unfollowed them.</p>


<p class="s3 s4">Why do the questions above just refer to photos? Can't you share videos on Roll too?</p>
<p class="s2">Yes, sorry. Everywhere you see "photos" please imagine it says "photos or video" (except for in this question).</p>


<p class="s3 s4">Someone invited me to Roll and I donâ€™t want to be invited again! Grr!</p>
<p class="s2">No problem - Just tap "unsubscribe" on the email or reply "stop" to the text. This will block all future friends from inviting you.</p>


<p class="s2"><br/>Still not sure of something? <span class="c1"><a href="mailto:feedback@tryroll.com">Email us</a></span> and we can help.<br/><br/>Thanks for using Roll!</p>
